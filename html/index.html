                Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
                learning new things from everywhere etc.).</li>

        <li>Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
                freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
                Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)</li>
